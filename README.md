# Flash Card Program

A flash card program that helps learn words from The Quran. It shows a word from The Quran and after some time shows the English meaning of that word. Then the user gets to choose if they knew the word or not.
I was inspired by a youtube series made to learn the most common words from The Quran by [Arabic 101](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6TlMIZ5ylgrYBl5c2LGoc1iwTPyYMMYH&si=Wig15OMNJ-8zlr__). This program will help practice those words daily.

## Features

- Displays Arabic words.
- Shows English answer after some time.
- Keeps track of ticked known words. They will not appear again.
- Keeps track of ticked unknown words in a file and they will appear again.
- Option to reset after completing learning all words once.
