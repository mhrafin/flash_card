# Quranic Word Flashcard Program üìñ

A flash card program that helps learn words from The Quran. It shows a word from The Quran and after some time shows the English meaning of that word. Then the user gets to choose if they knew the word or not. I was inspired by a youtube series made to learn the most common words from The Quran by Arabic 101. This program will help practice those words daily.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Interactive Flashcards**: Displays a word and its meaning for effective learning.
- **Personalized Learning**: Tracks which words you've learned and ensures you focus on unlearned words.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows users to reset their progress and start fresh.
- **Supports Daily Practice**: Designed to encourage consistent engagement for vocabulary building.
- **Inspirational Source**: Inspired by the YouTube series "Learn the Most Common Words from the Quran" by *Arabic 101*.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. The program starts by displaying an Arabic word.
2. After 6 seconds, it flips the card to reveal the English meaning.
3. The user can click:
   - ‚úÖ **Knew It**: Marks the word as learned.
   - ‚ùå **Didn't Know It**: Adds the word to a "need to learn" list.
4. Words marked as learned will not be repeated until reset.
